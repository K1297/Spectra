# Spectra Strategy Guide

Advanced strategies to maximize your winnings in Spectra.

## Understanding the Odds

### Survival Probability
- **Per Round:** 20% (1 in 5)
- **2 Rounds:** 4% (1 in 25)
- **3 Rounds:** 0.8% (1 in 125)
- **5 Rounds:** 0.032% (1 in 3,125)

### Expected Value

$$EV = \text{Stake} \times 1.2^{\text{Score}} \times P(\text{Survive})$$

**Example:** 0.01 STT stake, score 3
$$EV = 0.01 \times 1.728 \times 0.008 = 0.00001382 \text{ STT}$$

## Decision Making

### When to Claim

**Claim if:**
- Score ≥ 3 (1.728x reward)
- Feeling lucky is gone
- Bankroll is low
- Emotional state is poor

**Continue if:**
- Score < 3 (low reward)
- Bankroll is healthy
- Feeling confident
- Time available

### Probability of Reaching Score

| Score | Probability | Odds |
|-------|-------------|------|
| 1 | 20% | 1 in 5 |
| 2 | 4% | 1 in 25 |
| 3 | 0.8% | 1 in 125 |
| 4 | 0.16% | 1 in 625 |
| 5 | 0.032% | 1 in 3,125 |
| 10 | 0.0000001% | 1 in 10 billion |

## Bankroll Management

### Kelly Criterion

$$f^* = \frac{bp - q}{b}$$

Where:
- b = odds (1.2x = 0.2)
- p = win probability (0.2)
- q = loss probability (0.8)

$$f^* = \frac{0.2 \times 0.2 - 0.8}{0.2} = -3$$

**Interpretation:** Negative Kelly means the game has negative expected value. Don't play with money you can't afford to lose.

### Bankroll Allocation

**Total Bankroll:** 1 STT

- **Conservative:** 0.01 STT per game (100 games)
- **Balanced:** 0.05 STT per game (20 games)
- **Aggressive:** 0.1 STT per game (10 games)

### Stop-Loss Rules

- Stop if bankroll drops 50%
- Stop if losing 5 consecutive games
- Stop if emotional state deteriorates

## Psychological Factors

### Gambler's Fallacy
**Myth:** "I've lost 3 times, so I'm due to win"
**Reality:** Each round is independent (20% chance always)

### Hot Hand Fallacy
**Myth:** "I'm on a winning streak, keep going"
**Reality:** Randomness, not skill. Claim your winnings.

### Loss Aversion
**Myth:** "I need to keep playing to recover losses"
**Reality:** Accept losses, move on, play another day

## Advanced Tactics

### Martingale System (Not Recommended)
- Double stake after each loss
- Claim after first win
- **Problem:** Exponential stake growth, bankroll depletion

### Paroli System (Recommended)
- Double stake after each win
- Reset after loss
- **Advantage:** Limits downside, maximizes upside

**Example:**
- Round 1: 0.01 STT stake, win → 0.012 STT reward
- Round 2: 0.012 STT stake, win → 0.0144 STT reward
- Round 3: 0.0144 STT stake, lose → Game over

### Flat Betting (Best)
- Same stake every game
- Claim at predetermined score
- **Advantage:** Consistent, predictable, sustainable

## Optimal Strategy

### For Entertainment
- Stake: 0.01 STT
- Target: Score 2
- Claim: Always at score 2
- Expected: 1.2x return, 20% success

### For Profit
- Stake: 0.05 STT
- Target: Score 3
- Claim: At score 3 or loss
- Expected: 1.728x return, 0.8% success

### For Maximum Thrill
- Stake: 0.1 STT
- Target: Score 5
- Claim: At score 5 or loss
- Expected: 2.488x return, 0.032% success
